I have been learning machine learning and data science skills for over one year, and completed zero to data science bootcamp on jovian.ai, completed 1 project on web scraping and 2 exploratory data analysis projects, currently working on a machine learning project. Looking for a Data Scientist, Data Analyst and Product Analyst role.
